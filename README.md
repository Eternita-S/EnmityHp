# EnemyListHP
Adds little display to enemy list that shows enemy hp. Like this:

Note: this will not always match target bar %. Target bar % always uses rounding down, while enmity list uses normal rounding.
|Real %|Target bar display %|Enmity display %|
|---|---|---|
|99.8%|99%|100%|
|99.2%|99%|99%|

Minimal configuration and no extra precision because I want to keep this as simple as it's ever possible and this plugin has an extremely niche usage anyway. 
Feel free to create a fork and customize it in any way if you wish.

## Install
Type `/xlplugins`, find `EnemyListHP` in plugin list and install it.
